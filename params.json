(Parent of your web generally, not tested in a sub directory).\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone git@github.com:hrabbit/url-wallboard.git\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstall composer\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstall requirements\r\n\r\n```\r\nphp composer.phar update\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou should be ready to roll. The 'web' directory is your DocumentRoot and therefore should be named to suite.\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\n### Apache2\r\n\r\nThere is a .htaccess included in this repository ready to work. If required, tweak the RewriteBase directive to suite.\r\n\r\n### Nginx\r\n\r\nBelow are the requirements for your service configuration. Nginx is not my strongest area so any more info here will be taken appreciatively.\r\n\r\n```\r\nserver {\r\n    #site root is redirected to the app boot script\r\n    location = / {\r\n        try_files @site @site;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    #all other locations try other files first and go to our front controller if none of them exists\r\n    location / {\r\n        try_files $uri $uri/ @site;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    #return 404 for all php files as we do have a front controller\r\n    location ~ \\.php$ {\r\n        return 404;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    location @site {\r\n        fastcgi_pass   unix:/var/run/php-fpm/www.sock;\r\n        include fastcgi_params;\r\n        fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root/index.php;\r\n        #uncomment when running via https\r\n        #fastcgi_param HTTPS on;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
